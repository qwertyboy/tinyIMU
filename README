The tinyIMU is a small, simple-to-use triple-axis accelerometer and gyroscope breakout board.

Features:
	-BMA220 3-axis accelerometer
	-L3G4200D 3-axis gyroscope
	-3.3V operation
	-Onboard 1.8V regulator for BMA220
	-SPI or I2C communication interface
	-Accelerometer interrupt output
	-Gyroscope "data ready" output
	-Small size - 1.05" x 0.75"

This is NOT the same tinyIMU as the one from Youritronics. They are NOT compatible with each other. Besides using different devices, the Youritronics model has 9 degrees of freedom, where this one only has 6.

Arduino library coming soon!
